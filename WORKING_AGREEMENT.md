# Working Agreement

Our team is committed to maintaining clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability throughout the project. We agree to use Microsoft Teams and GitHub as our primary collaboration tools, ensuring that all updates, code changes, and discussions are accessible to every team member. Meetings will be scheduled weekly, and all members are expected to attend on time or notify the group in advance if they cannot. During meetings, each member will share progress and blockers to keep everyone aligned.

We will follow a collaborative workflow by creating branches for new features and submitting pull requests for review before merging into the main branch. Direct commits to the main branch are not allowed, as peer review helps maintain quality and shared responsibility. Every member is expected to review pull requests promptly, provide constructive feedback, and resolve conflicts respectfully.

Task assignments will be based on user stories, and each member is responsible for completing their assigned work before the sprint deadline. If a member faces challenges, they are encouraged to reach out to the group for help rather than working in isolation. This ensures that tasks are completed on time and knowledge is shared equally across the team.

We will maintain professional and respectful communication at all times. Disagreements will be resolved through open discussion and, if needed, by deferring to the group majority. Our goal is to create an inclusive, collaborative environment where everyoneâ€™s contributions are valued.

Finally, we agree to uphold academic integrity, follow the project requirements, and commit to producing high-quality deliverables as a team. This agreement ensures that we remain accountable to one another and that our project progresses smoothly and fairly.
