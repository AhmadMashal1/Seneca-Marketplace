## Project Description

Buying and selling used textbooks and personal items at Seneca is currently fragmented and inefficient. Students often rely on social media groups, scattered chats, or word of mouth, which leads to confusion, missed opportunities, and even safety concerns. Furthermore, there is no dedicated platform designed specifically for Seneca students that integrates campus meeting points across King, Newnham, and Seneca@York, making in-person transactions inconvenient and unorganized.

To address these challenges, this project introduces *Seneca Marketplace*, a campus-exclusive platform where students can securely buy and sell textbooks, electronics, and everyday essentials. Key features include Seneca-verified authentication, item listings with photos and categories, search and filtering tools, and an integrated meet-up location selector for safe campus exchanges. By centralizing these services, the marketplace will create a reliable, safe, and efficient way for students to exchange goods while reducing waste and strengthening the campus community.

The platform is developed using **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive front-end hosted on **Vercel**, and a **Node.js/Express** back-end hosted on **Render**. Data storage is handled by either **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**, depending on project requirements for flexibility and scalability. Authentication is managed through **Clerk**, with support for third-party sign-ins (Google, Outlook, Facebook) via **Firebase integrations**. The development workflow leverages **Visual Studio Code** for coding, **Postman** for API testing, and GitHub for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and clear separation of front-end and back-end tasks.
