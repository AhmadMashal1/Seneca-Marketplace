## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop **Seneca Marketplace**, a secure, campus-exclusive online platform for Seneca College students to buy and sell used textbooks, electronics, and personal items. Currently, students rely on informal communication channels such as social media or word of mouth, which leads to inefficiencies, safety concerns, and missed opportunities.  

Seneca Marketplace will centralize this process by offering verified student authentication, item listings with categories and images, secure messaging, and campus-based meet-up scheduling. The goal is to improve convenience, security, and community engagement while reducing waste and promoting reuse within the Seneca student body.
